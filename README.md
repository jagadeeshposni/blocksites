# blocksites

Thanks for being here.
Blocksites is a chrome extension which is an experimental learning project executed as part of learning java script. The idea is simple, After installing the extension, the user can configure the sites by adding them through the text field provided and extensions prevents the user from openign the sites because,he has chosen to block them.

The main logic is present as part of echo.js which is triggered as soon as the popup page for the extension opens.
Concepts like chrome storage, Content script, background pages are added.

Once again, Thanks for being here.
